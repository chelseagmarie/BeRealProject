Chelsea Garcia:
* Microsoft Teams
    * Microsoft Teams is both a work and personal app that allows you to make a work account to chat with coworkers and a personal account to chat with family, friends, and community. That makes it stand out because it has a dual purpose, having one app for 2 parts of a person's life.
    * In Teams (personal), you can tell that you are the owner of a commmunity because of a small "owner" badge that makes it easy to differentiate between being a member and an owner.

* Linkedin
    * Linkedin is the only app I know of that notifies you that another person has viewed your profile/page. 
    * In addition to being a "professional social media", it also allows you to look at open roles at companies in your industry.

* Apple Music
    * Apple Music allows users to not only add to the end of a queue but has two separate buttons: "add last" and "add next". This makes it easy for a user to interact with the app quickly rather than having to move around songs in a queue.
    * Apple Music allows users to do "karoake" by having a feature that can give you as much of the artist's voice as you'd like. Want just the instrumental so you can karoake to it? You can make that happen. Want the artist to sing, but just lower? You can make that happen. Want to hear the song in its entirety? You can make it happen.







Laura Castro:
* Pinterest
    * Pinterest prioritize sharing ideas rather than people like instagram or facebook, pinterest promotes sharing creative 'pins' and inspire other users to do the same. Crafts, outfits, vision boards, etc.
    * Unlike other social media apps, pinterest has harvested a positive community of users where comments on posts are not the norm, heavily putting an emphasis on the content instead of opening the floor to negative feedback and allowing for any negative echo chambers to form.
* Google Maps
    * Adds extra layers of 'personality' to the business and shops on its app. Has a feature that allows customers to know the traffic trends of the business on an hourly basis. This allows users to time their meals in case they don't want to encounter crowds.
    * Google Maps rewards users for reviewing places, giving them different tiers the more they review. With enough reviews, users can gain a following, earn prizes and recieve personalized recommendations.
    * Google Maps uses reviews to power keyword searches. Ex. if a restaurant has a review including the words "great lasagna" and I search lasagna on google maps, that restaurant along with its review will be highlighted to indicate that this might have what I'm looking for.
* WhatsApp
    * Allows for international and local communications at no extra cost such as those which SMS would incur. This interconnectivity across long distances is why many have turned to WhatsApp as their main messaging format.
    * End-to-end encryption is why many have turned to WhatsApp for secure communications with an extra layer of piece of mind.



Giuliana Russi:
* Pandora
    *  Pandora creates radio like music stations for its users to explore and be introduced to new music. 
    *  It allows users to "Thumbs up" or "Thumbs down" a song which would affect the frequency in which that song or songs similar to it would be played. 
    *   Pandora for its premium subscribers who pay a fee are allowed to listen to music ad free and without and internet connection. 
* Google Calendar
    *  Google Calendar has the ability to have shared calendars so that you can share activities with family members or the community. With shared calendars you can see how things overlap with a friend or work.
    *  Google calendar can also integrate with your gmail account allowing for events that were emailed to be added to your calendar seamlessly. 
* Zoom
    * Zoom was the preferred platform when the pandemic started for its virtual meeting capabilities. Its audio and visual quality made meetings seamless. It also included a way to share your screen so other participants would be able to see your screen to work on projects and collaborations
    * Zoom also introduced virtual backgrounds that added a fun way to conceal your environment and maintain the privacy of your space.
